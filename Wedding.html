        <p> Flowers have long played a central role in wedding ceremonies thanks to the amount of symbolism they carry.
            The bouquet represents the bride's individuality, style, and personal taste, much like the unique journey that led her to her partner. As she walks down the aisle,
             the bouquet symbolizes the beauty of her transition from single life to marital unityâ€”a testament to the commitment she is making. </p>
